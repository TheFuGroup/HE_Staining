# HE Staining MATLAB script
To use this script the source image must be in an RGB color format.
Using imageJ, the image can be converted from merged color to RGB color on the imageJ toolbar selection Image>Type>RGB Color.

Green should be set to the lipids channel and Blue should be set to the proteins channel. Example images are provided as test1.tif for a representative RGB color image and test1_HE.tif for a representative false stained HE color image.

The script will prompt the user to select the source image to convert. Ensure that MATLAB is able to open the path to the RGB color source image.
